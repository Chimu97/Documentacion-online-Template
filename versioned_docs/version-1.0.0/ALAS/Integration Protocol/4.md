# Export items from ALAS into 3rd. party system

## Description

- This API needs to be build and provided by the Courier, and needs to be called by POST method. It is 
responsible for exporting new items from Alas system into the Courier System.
- **THE ANSWER MUST BE ASYNCHRONOUS, with a 200 code status.**
    - The Courier at their end must deploy a logic to avoid receiving duplicated items corresponding to the last days: this is 
to avoid them in case of a re-manifest is requested by the courier. From ALAS we cannot filter them, due to the 
fact ALAS doesn’t know which was received before and which was disregarded, or missed by the Courier, which 
supports the re-manifest request.
    - The courier from your side must know and implement how to tolerate duplicate "Box_References" within a period of 
no less than 60 days from each other. This is because Inditex, after 60 days of using that "Box_Reference" is 
likely to use it again with a new shipment, since ITX uses ranges of numbers, and therefore sooner or later will 
reuse them.
- The body is in array format and all its fields must be accepted. 
- In case of the request takes more than 60 seconds, it will give an internal timeout error.
- In case we get a timeout on our first attempt, or receive any type of error, will happen a second attempt after 5 
minutes of the first, with the same timeout policy.
- A third attempt will happened after 5 minutes of the second attempt.
- In the event that after the third attempt, ALAS continues to receive an error or timeout, the retries will be suspended, 
triggering an automatic email that will notify the Courier (to the email address that has been configured for this purpose) and also different Inditex departments including T.E.C.
- Il be solely the responsibility of the Courier to take corrective measures and resolve the situation ASAP that prevents receiving the manifests.
- Once the problem is resolved, the Courier will contact ALAS in writing via email to support@zectorpro.com notifying. 
ALAS that the reception error at the Courier end was fixed, and are ready to receive a re-manifest.

### Comments

- tracking_number: the code is the same as box_reference when you use the generated label 
original from ITX. 
- When a label is generated by ALAS, it comprises the code agreed upon with the courier and is generated in the format specified by the courier.
Additionally, it's necessary to create a relational table between the tracking number and the Box 
Reference.
